<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</h3>
<p>A movie that I can really relate.</p>

<h3>Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour</h3>
<p>Not totally a fan of Taylor. But after watching this, I am converted.</p>

<h3>Before Trilogy</h3>
<p>This movie gives me a feeling that is unexplainable.</p>
